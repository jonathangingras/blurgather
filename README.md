# blurgather
simple password manager library using mcrypt for its cryptography backend and msgpack for persistence

blurgather is written in plain C (tested in C++ with gtest) in an OO-fashion way, trying as much as possible to follow the Dependency Inversion Principle.

There is currently a VERY basic cli frontend included in the repo, but the library is not intented for sofisticated frontend, much more for simplicity and reliability plus portability.
