# blurgather [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathangingras/blurgather.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathangingras/blurgather)

simple password manager library using mcrypt for its cryptography backend and msgpack for persistence

blurgather is written in plain C in an OO-fashion, trying as much as possible to follow the Dependency Inversion Principle.

There is currently a VERY basic cli frontend included in the repo, but the library is not intended for sophisticated frontend, much more for simplicity and reliability plus portability.
